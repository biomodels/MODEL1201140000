**Abstract:**   
In the presence of an insulinotropic glucose concentration, beta-cells, in
intact pancreatic islets, exhibit periodic bursting electrical activity
consisting of an alternation of active and silent phases. The fraction of time
spent in the active phase over a period is called the plateau fraction and is
correlated with the rate of insulin release. However, the mechanisms that
regulate the plateau fraction remain unclear. In this paper we investigate the
possible role of the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange of the beta-cell in
controlling the plateau fraction. We have extended different single-cell
models to incorporate this Ca2+-activated electrogenic Ca2+ transporter. We
find that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange can provide a physiological mechanism to
increase the plateau fraction as the glucose concentration is raised. In
addition, we show theoretically that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a key regulator
of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration in clusters of heterogeneous cells
with gap-junctional electrical coupling.
